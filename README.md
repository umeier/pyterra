# PyTerra Python Library for Field Simplification

This software is based on the `terra`-Software by Michael Garland. I found the sources on 
http://mgarland.org/files/dist/terra-0.7.tar.gz

See http://mgarland.org/software/terra.html

Still heavy work in progress. No documentation so far.

As the code used by me is in the public domain, so is mine.
